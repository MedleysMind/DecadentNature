Decadent Nature Website

This is the website for the music collective Decadent Nature, specifically it's for Rick G the founder and head of the collective. The goal is to create a single page website that works as a single cumulative hub for all social media. The site includes plugins for SoundCloud, Spotify and Youtube. There are links to Apple Music, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, Spotify and Soundcloud. The challenge is to manage to take all of these and apply them to the site without it feeling cluttered or overwhelming.
